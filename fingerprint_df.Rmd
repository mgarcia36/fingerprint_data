title: "Fingerprint Data Frame"
author: "Marta Garc√≠a"
date: "July 9, 2017"

---
### The data frame will have 6 columns:
- participant name
- question (number 1:10 and letter A-E)
- treatment (one to one or one to many)
- response per question (T/F, 1/0)
- grade per question (T/F)
- order of tests administered (1:10)

### This code will create 10 data frames (one per participant) and then stack all 10 to create the final data frame.

We will create a vector for question and for the solutions 
and then reuse it per data frame since it is constant per person.
```{r}
# vector question will be used as column 2 in every data frame
question <- c("1A", "1B", "1C", "1D", "1E",
              "2A", "2B", "2C", "2D", "2E",
              "3A", "3B", "3C", "3D", "3E",
              "4A", "4B", "4C", "4D", "4E",
              "5A", "5B", "5C", "5D", "5E",
              "6A", "6B", "6C", "6D", "6E",
              "7A", "7B", "7C", "7D", "7E",
              "8A", "8B", "8C", "8D", "8E",
              "9A", "9B", "9C", "9D", "9E",
              "10A", "10B", "10C", "10D", "10E")

# vector answer_key are the answers to questions
# will run later again participant responses to see if participant answered question correctly
